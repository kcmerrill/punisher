Punisher is a simple app that will run a command repeatedly. The need for this app came about because I'm always finding myself writing one off scripts to run commands. Be it hammering a mysql database to test [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost) migrations, testing [genie](https://github.com/kcmerrill/genie) or others.
